# Expense-Tracker

Build an advanced expense tracker web application which allows users to create, read, update and delete expenses across multiple categories and then calculates the statistical data such as past month, week and year expenses spread across categories. 

We also visually represent these expenses in charts using CharJS and also learn how data from Django backed database could be loaded into dynamic JavaScript charts.

## This is how the application looks like:
